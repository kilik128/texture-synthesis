 Image Quilting with Wang Tile Generation, by Clay Heaton, 2015.
 
 This sketch provides an example implementation of the image quilting 
 algorithm described by Alexei Efros and William Freeman in their 
 oft-cited paper from 2001. A copy of the paper is included in the 
 sketch's data folder. Look here for more info:
 http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/~efros/
 
 From one or two original images (that should be similar, if using two),
 the algorithm "quilts" together samples from those images, seeking the 
 overlap seams between samples that minimizes the color differences. 
 Given the appropriate input image, the effect is that this can create 
 larger images, of arbitrary size, that do not look like they were 
 assembled by tiling the original image. 
 
 The A* algorithm is used to find the lowest-cost seam in overlap
 areas, vs. Dijkstra's, as described in the original paper. This
 works because we insert dummy "start" and "end" nodes in the graph
 constructed from overlapping pixels, then prune them away when we
 have found the minimal path between them. I couldn't figure out
 why there would be any advantage to the computational overhead
 of Dijkstra. My A* heuristic is lame, but it still works. :)
 
 Wang tile generation is described in the paper from MS Research Labs,
 called "Wang Tiles for Image and Texture Generation," by Cohen, Shade,
 Hiller, and Deussen. It is included in the data folder.
