## Texture Synthesis with Image Quilting and Wang Tiles

Well... ok, just image quilting for now. :) 

Image quilting was described by Effros and Freeman in a 2001 paper that you can find [on this page](http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/~efros/).

Basically, starting with a small image, you can quilt samples of it together in a clever way such as to create a large image that does not appear to be made from tiles or even from repeated sections of a small image.  For example, starting with this image of gravel:

![Image_Quilting/data/gravel3.png](Image_Quilting/data/gravel3.png)

We can generate this image:

![img/biggravel.png](img/biggravel.png)

More examples...

source image:

![Image_Quilting/data/pinkflowers.png](Image_Quilting/data/pinkflowers.png)

result:

![img/largepink.png](img/largepink.png)
